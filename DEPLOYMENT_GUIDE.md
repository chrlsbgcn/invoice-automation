- First request after sleep might take 30-60 seconds
- File processing takes 10-30 seconds depending on PDF size

### Security
- Files are processed on the server and automatically deleted
- No data is stored permanently
- Each user gets their own temporary workspace

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Build failed"**: Check that all files are committed to GitHub
2. **"App won't start"**: Check the logs in your deployment platform
3. **"OCR not working"**: The free tiers might have limited OCR support

### Getting Help
- Check the deployment platform's logs
- Make sure all files are in your GitHub repository
- Try uploading a simple text-based PDF first

## üéâ Success!

Once deployed, your girlfriend can:
1. **Open the URL** you share with her
2. **Upload any PDF invoice**
3. **Get instant CSV/Excel downloads**
4. **Use it from anywhere** - no software needed!
